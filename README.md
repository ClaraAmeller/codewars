## This are my katas from codewars.com
### Why I'm doing this
I think it's a good way to show my knowledge, to provide solutions out of the codewars forum and to keep track of my results.
Also, I like the idea of going back to the 6kyu folder in a few months and realizing all the things I would do differently.

#### Note
I started this repo the same day as I upgraded to level 5, so "the easiest" katas are missing.
